# Introduction
According to this assignment, I have learnt to create a car loan calculator including write a pseudocode, draw a flow chart and write a java code. I have learnt the formula to calculate and apply in java program.

# Pseudocode
START
Output "Enter car price (RM)"
Input car price
Loop the input car price while the car price less than RM30000
Output "Enter down payment (RM)"
Input down payment
Loop the input down payment while the down payment less than RM0
Output "Enter loan period (year)"
Input loan period
Loop the input loan period while the loan period less than 5 years or more than 9 years
Output "Enter interest rate (%)"
Input interest rate
Loop the input interest rate while the interest rate less than 3 or more than 7
Calculate monthly repayment (RM)
Total Interest = (car price-down payment) * (interest rate/100) * loan period
Total Payment = (car price-down payment) + total interest
Monthly Payment = total payment / (loan period*12)
Output monthly repayment
Calculate principal = (total payment/loan period)
Calculate interest = (total interest/loan period)
Calculate balance = total payment-(total payment/loan period)
Output years, principal, interest, balance
Loop years, principal, interest, balance depend on the loan period
